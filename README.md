1. Linked List
Linked List:- A list that is linked. contain a set of nodes. Node has two elements the value of data and the pointer to the next node in list.
-> first node is called head and last is called tail. Null indicates the end of the list.
Why linked list:- Allow you to insert value in the middle of the list by simply resetting a few pointers.
-> This is same for deleting node.
-> Sorted data.

Scalability:-
   prepend - O(1),
   append - O(1),
   lookup - O(n),
   insert - O(n),
   delete - O(n)

2. Doubly Linked List:- It has an extra pices of data that also link to the previous node. It allows us to traverse our list backward.


Scalability:-
prepend -> O(1),
append -> O(1),
lookup -> O(n),
insert -> O(n),
delete -> O(n)
